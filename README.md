**1- Exploratory Analysis**

In this first chapter, we will prepare and explore your new dataset in Tableau to set things up for your inventory analysis. Of course, as with a real-world dataset, things might not be perfect, so we should keep your eyes open to check your data is in order and that all required variables for analysis are readily available.

**2- Inventory Analysis**

Here, we will continue developing more interesting metrics and methods for inventory analysis in Tableau, such as inventory turnover and ABC analysis, to help us investigate which items are best for Acropolis Retail Inc.

**3- Reporting Inventory Analytics**

In the final chapter, it's time to start creating dashboards to share information with suitable applications on management practices, such as assisting in purchase decisions to improve stock management efficiently.
